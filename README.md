# St-Josephs-Annual-Datathon-3rd-place-solution
## This is the solution to the Annual St Josephs Datathon. Me and my team were placed 3rd in the competition.
### Solution details:
The hackathon was a 2 phase hackathon. The 1st phase of the hackathon was ranking IPL players using past 10 years data. The second part of the hackathon was predicting discount classes in medical whoelsale orders.
1. For ranking players we used PCA and reduced all features to a single feature which described 80% of the variance in the dataset. This was then used to rank players.
2. For the second part of the hackathon, our final submission was a hard vote of the classes predicted by ANN,RNN, Random Forest and other primitive machine learning models.
